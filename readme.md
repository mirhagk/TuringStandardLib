Turing Standard Library in .NET====This project is an implementation of the standard library included in Turing 4.1.1, written in .NET. There are 3 primary purposes for this:1. The TSharp project, which is a Turing to .NET compiler, will make use of this standard library to compile unmodified Turing projects.2. The Turing standard library is a great learning tool, since it allows programmers to use graphics and create things, without all the traditional overhead. Even if the Turing language itself is not taught, the library is useful as learning tool with any .NET language.3. To allow beginner programmers that have only ever used Turing to expand into other languages, without moving backwards because of unfamiliarity with a new standard library.Roadmap---+ 0.1 - Ability to support most basic commands that beginners would use+ 0.2 - Support for all normal graphics and text functions+ 0.3 - Support for other components of standard library, file I/O, pictures, sounds etc+ 1.0 - Fully validated release that can run all of the examples distributed with 4.1.1Contribute---If you'd like to contribute, feel free to clone this repo and flesh out commands. Let me know what you plan on doing. Also be aware that some re-organization of project structure is coming very soon.You can also contribute by writing test programs, or using it and logging any bugs.
